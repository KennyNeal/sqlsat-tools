# sqlsat-tools

Reusable event tooling for Day of Data Baton Rouge (and future SQL Saturday events).
Generates attendee SpeedPasses, emails them, prints the paper schedule, and produces
the sponsor stamp game card — all driven by a single config file.

## Quick start for a new event

```
1. Copy event.config.template.json → event.config.json
2. Fill in your credentials and event IDs (see Config reference below)
3. Run: .\scripts\Test-EventReadiness.ps1   (preflight — checks config, secrets, data sources, tools)
4. Run: .\scripts\Initialize-Database.ps1 -Config (Get-Content event.config.json | ConvertFrom-Json)
5. Run: .\Update-Event.ps1
```

That's it. Re-run `Update-Event.ps1` daily as new registrations come in.

## Prerequisites

| Requirement | Notes |
|---|---|
| PowerShell 7+ | Recommended |
| Microsoft Edge | Used for headless PDF generation, and to rasterize SVG sponsor logos for the slide template |
| Python 3 | Used by `Generate-SlideTemplate.ps1` and `Generate-RaffleDeck.ps1`; `python-pptx` and `Pillow` are installed automatically on first run |
| `PSSQLite` module | Installed automatically on first run |
| `powershell-yaml` module | Installed automatically on first run |
| `Microsoft.PowerShell.SecretManagement` | For storing credentials securely |

Install SecretManagement once:
```powershell
Install-Module Microsoft.PowerShell.SecretManagement, Microsoft.PowerShell.SecretStore -Scope CurrentUser
Register-SecretVault -Name LocalVault -ModuleName Microsoft.PowerShell.SecretStore
```

---

## Credential setup

**EventBrite token**
```powershell
# Get your token from https://www.eventbrite.com/platform/api-keys
Set-Secret -Name "EventbriteToken" -Secret "your-token-here"
```

**Gmail**
```powershell
# Use a Gmail App Password (not your real password)
# https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords
Set-Secret -Name "SQLSaturday-Gmail" -Secret (Get-Credential)
```

| `websiteRepo.owner` | GitHub org or user that owns the website repo |
| `websiteRepo.name` | GitHub repo name |
| `websiteRepo.branch` | Branch to read from (usually `main`) |
| `websiteRepo.eventKey` | Folder under `content/events/` in the website repo (e.g. `dodbr-2026`). Event name, sponsor data file, and event logo are all read from that folder's `_index.md` at runtime. |
| `sessionize.eventId` | Sessionize **JSON** API endpoint ID (Sessionize → Embed & API → create an endpoint with format "JSON"). Note this is not the JS-embed ID the website uses. |
| `eventbrite.eventId` | Numeric EventBrite event ID (find it in the organizer dashboard URL) |
| `eventbrite.secretName` | SecretManagement secret name for the API token |
| `email.secretName` | SecretManagement secret name for Gmail credentials |
| `email.subject` | Email subject line |
| `email.fromName` | Display name in the From header |
| `speedpass.raffleTiers` | Sponsor tiers that get a raffle slip (e.g., `["global","platinum","gold","silver"]`) |
| `stampGame.tiers` | Sponsor tiers that appear on the stamp game card |
| `stampGame.excludeSponsors` | Sponsor names to skip even if they match a listed tier |
| `stampGame.gridColumns` | Number of columns in the stamp card grid (overridden automatically when logo count is a perfect square) |
| `slideTemplate.footerText` | Text shown in the bottom bar of the title and sponsor slides (e.g. a room policy reminder) |
| `slideTemplate.primaryColor` / `slideTemplate.secondaryColor` | Hex brand colors for the header/footer bars and slide text (shared with the raffle deck) |
| `slideTemplate.outputFile` | Where the generated `.potx` is written |
| `raffleDeck.individualTiers` | Sponsor tiers that get one slide per sponsor in the loop deck (e.g. `["global","platinum"]`) |
| `raffleDeck.gridGroups` | Remaining tiers grouped onto shared grid slide(s), in order (e.g. `[["gold"],["silver","bronze"],["book"]]`) |
| `raffleDeck.maxPerGridSlide` | Sponsors per grid slide before splitting onto another slide |
| `raffleDeck.loopAdvanceSeconds` | Seconds each loop-deck slide stays up before auto-advancing |
| `raffleDeck.excludeSponsors` | Sponsor names to skip in the raffle hero section (they still get a loop-deck recognition slide) — for sponsors not doing a drawing this year |
| `raffleDeck.footerText` | Bottom-bar text for the raffle deck; defaults to `event.hashtag` |
| `raffleDeck.outputFile` | Where the generated `.pptx` is written |

## Scripts

### Preflight

```powershell
# Validates everything the tools assume — config keys, secrets, website repo,
# sponsor logos, Sessionize, Eventbrite, Edge/SumatraPDF/printer, database —
# and reports PASS/WARN/FAIL per check. Run it the day before the event and
# again the morning of, so problems surface all at once instead of mid-run.
.\scripts\Test-EventReadiness.ps1
```

### Daily workflow

```powershell
# Full pipeline (import → generate PDFs → email)
.\Update-Event.ps1

# Preview what would happen
.\Update-Event.ps1 -WhatIf

# Step through each stage with confirmation
.\Update-Event.ps1 -StepThrough

# Individual steps
.\Update-Event.ps1 -ImportOnly
.\Update-Event.ps1 -GenerateOnly
.\Update-Event.ps1 -EmailOnly
```

### Check-in day (for helpers)

**Setting up a second laptop:** clone/copy this repo onto it, copy
`event.config.json`, `event.db`, and `lib\QRCoder.dll` over from the primary
laptop, then run `.\scripts\Setup-CheckinLaptop.ps1` — it installs
SumatraPDF/Edge/PSSQLite if missing, configures the secret vault with no
master password, and sanity-checks the printer. Each laptop runs an
**independent copy** of `event.db` (no live sync between desks yet — see
open issues), so re-copy `event.db` from the primary laptop right before the
event to pick up the latest registrations.

Whoever's running the registration desk doesn't need to touch PowerShell
directly — double-click **`Start-Checkin.bat`** in the repo root. It opens a
menu-driven console app (`scripts/Checkin-Menu.ps1`):

```
============================
   SQL Saturday Check-In
============================
[1] Check in an attendee
[2] Practice mode (no printing)
[3] Sync new registrations from Eventbrite
[4] Show walk-ins not yet in Eventbrite
[Q] Quit
```

- **Option 1** is the desk loop: type/scan an order # or email, it prints the
  badge label and asks for the next one. Unknown lookups prompt a quick-add
  walk-in form. Leave the lookup blank to return to the menu.
- **Option 2** is the same flow but only opens a preview of the label — no
  printing, no database changes — good for a dry run before doors open.
- **Option 3** re-runs `Import-Attendees.ps1` (needs the Eventbrite
  credential already set up — see Credential setup above). Runs immediately,
  no confirmation prompt, and retries up to 3 times on a flaky connection.
- **Option 4** shows the same report as `List-UnsyncedWalkins.ps1` below.

The menu is a thin wrapper around the same scripts and database described in
this section — `scripts/Checkin-Core.ps1` holds the shared lookup/print
logic so both the menu and the raw CLI script below stay in sync.

### Event-day tools

```powershell
$config = Get-Content .\event.config.json | ConvertFrom-Json

# Regenerate SpeedPass for one attendee
.\scripts\Generate-SpeedPasses.ps1 -Config $config -Email "jane.doe@example.com" -Force

# Stamp game card (run once when sponsors are finalized)
.\scripts\Generate-StampGame.ps1 -Config $config

# Paper schedule (run once sessions are published on Sessionize)
.\scripts\Generate-Schedule.ps1 -Config $config

# Presenter slide-deck template — title, sponsor thank-you, and eval slides
# (run once sponsors are finalized; re-run any time the sponsor roster changes)
.\scripts\Generate-SlideTemplate.ps1 -Config $config

# End-of-day raffle deck — a "Recognition" section (self-playing sponsor
# loop + eval QR slide) and a "Raffle" section (Raffle Time slide,
# manually-advanced hero slide per raffle-eligible sponsor, duplicate eval
# QR slide), each also saved as a same-named custom show. Launch each by
# name from Slide Show > Custom Slide Show (not F5/Shift+F5, which default
# to "All slides" and would otherwise autoplay through the whole deck) —
# Recognition loops until Esc; Esc out and launch Raffle when it's time.
# (run once sponsors are finalized; re-run any time the sponsor roster changes)
.\scripts\Generate-RaffleDeck.ps1 -Config $config

# Pre-print badge sheets in bulk (Avery 5392, 4"x3", 6-up)
.\scripts\Generate-NameTag.ps1 -Config $config

# Day-of registration / walk-ins: look up by order # or email, prints a
# single 2.4"x3.9" label (no background art) straight to the Brother
# QL-820NWB via SumatraPDF, for sticking onto pre-printed blank badges.
# With no -OrderId/-Email it loops, prompting for the next lookup, so one
# launch can serve the whole registration desk. Unknown order#/email
# triggers a quick-add prompt to register a true walk-in on the spot.
# Quick-added walk-ins are LOCAL ONLY (Eventbrite's API can't create real
# orders/attendees) — see List-UnsyncedWalkins.ps1 below.
.\scripts\Print-WalkinBadge.ps1 -Config $config
.\scripts\Print-WalkinBadge.ps1 -Config $config -Email "jane.doe@example.com"
.\scripts\Print-WalkinBadge.ps1 -Config $config -OrderId "123456789"

# See who was quick-added at the desk but still needs a matching free/comp
# order created in Eventbrite (dashboard or Box Office app) to stay in sync.
.\scripts\List-UnsyncedWalkins.ps1 -Config $config
```

## Data source: website repo

Sponsor names, tiers, and logos are read live from the
[sqlsatbr-website](https://github.com/KennyNeal/sqlsatbr-website) repo at runtime.
Update `data/sponsors/{sponsorDataFile}.yaml` in that repo and the next pipeline run
picks up the changes automatically — no manual sync needed.

Every successful fetch is also cached in `cache/` (gitignored). If a fetch fails —
say, no internet at the venue — the cached copy is used automatically, so anything
that ran once with connectivity keeps working offline. Delete `cache/` to force
fresh downloads.

---

## Database

`event.db` is a local SQLite file (gitignored). Three tables:

| Table | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `Attendees` | Upserted on every import — holds all registrant data. Walk-ins added via `Print-WalkinBadge.ps1` get `TicketType = 'Walk-in'` and an `OrderId` of `WALKIN` |
| `ProcessedAttendees` | Tracks `SpeedPassGeneratedAt` and `EmailedAt` per attendee |
| `PrintedBadges` | Tracks `PrintedAt`/`PrintedBy` per attendee for the day-of badge printer, so staff can see reprint status at the desk |

Reset an attendee's status (to regenerate + re-email):
```sql
DELETE FROM ProcessedAttendees WHERE Barcode = 'xxx';
```
